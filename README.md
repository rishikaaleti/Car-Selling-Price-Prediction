The project aims to predict used car prices in poorer countries, where secondhand cars are popular due to affordability. It involves statistical analysis, visualizations, and regression modeling, focusing on key attributes influencing car prices.







## Description
Used Car Price forecast is a hot issue due to  the volume of cars purchased and sold. People in poor countries prefer to buy secondhand cars since they are more affordable. The project's main goal is to estimate used carâ€™s selling price using factors that are substantially connected with different attributes of the dataset. Statistical Analysis, visualizations and regression modelling has been used to do this. 
During pre-processing, null, redundant, and missing values were omitted from the dataset. Two regressors (Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression were trained, tested, and evaluated against a benchmark dataset in this supervised learning study. 
This project aims to deliver price prediction models to the public, to help guide the individuals looking to buy or sell cars and to give them a better insight into the automotive sector. Another goal of the project is to explore new methods to evaluate used cars prices and to compare their accuracies.







## Project Goals
The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the selling price of used cars based on various attributes such as make, model, age, mileage, and condition. This model aims to provide accurate price predictions to assist buyers and sellers in the secondhand car market.
